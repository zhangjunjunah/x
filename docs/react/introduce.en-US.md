Polyfills are needed for IE browsers. We recommend [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) for it. You can set `targets` config if you are using [umi](http://umijs.org/).

## Version

- Stable: [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ant-design/x.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ant-design/x)

You can subscribe to this feed for new version notifications: https://github.com/ant-design/x/releases.atom

## Installation

### Using npm or yarn or pnpm or bun

**We recommend using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) to install**, it not only makes development easier, but also allow you to take advantage of the rich ecosystem of Javascript packages and tooling.

<InstallDependencies npm='$ npm install @ant-design/x --save' yarn='$ yarn add antd' pnpm='$ pnpm install antd --save' bun='$ bun add antd'></InstallDependencies>

If you are in a bad network environment, you can try other registries and tools like [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).

### Import in Browser

Add `script` and `link` tags in your browser and use the global variable `antd`.

We provide `antdx.js`, `antdx.min.js`, and `antdx.min.js.map` in the `dist` directory of the npm package. You can also download them via [![CDNJS](https://img.shields.io/cdnjs/v/@ant-design/x.svg?style=flat-square)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/@ant-design), [![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/@ant-design/x/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@ant-design/x), or [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/@ant-design/x/dist/).

> **We strongly discourage loading the entire files** this will add bloat to your application and make it more difficult to receive bugfixes and updates. Antd is intended to be used in conjunction with a build tool, such as [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), which will make it easy to import only the parts of antd that you are using.

> Note: You should import `react`、`react-dom`、`dayjs` before using `antdx.js`.

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Bubble } from '@ant-design/x';

const App = () => {
  return <Bubble content="Hello World!" />;
};

export default App;
```

### Use modularized antd

`@ant-design/x` supports ES modules tree shaking by default.

### TypeScript

`@ant-design/x` provides a built-in ts definition.
